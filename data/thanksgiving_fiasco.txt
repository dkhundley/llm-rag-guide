The Great Thanksgiving Turkey Fiasco

Thanksgiving had always been Sarah Thompson’s favorite holiday. Growing up, she remembered the warmth of her grandmother’s kitchen, the scent of cinnamon and nutmeg dancing in the air, and the symphony of laughter that echoed through the halls. It was a time when the world seemed to slow down, allowing everyone to appreciate the simple joys of family, food, and gratitude.

This year was particularly special for Sarah. After years of apartment living, she and her husband, Tom, had finally moved into their dream home—a charming, two-story house nestled in the suburbs with just enough yard for their golden retriever, Max, to frolic in. The house had a spacious kitchen with gleaming granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances that begged to be used for a grand feast. Sarah decided it was the perfect time to host her first family Thanksgiving dinner.

For weeks leading up to the big day, Sarah immersed herself in planning. She scoured through cookbooks, watched countless cooking shows, and even attended a Thanksgiving cooking class at the local culinary school. Her Pinterest boards were overflowing with recipes, centerpiece ideas, and DIY decorations. She was determined to make this Thanksgiving not just good, but legendary—especially since her mother-in-law, Margaret Thompson, would be attending.

Margaret was a woman who exuded elegance and precision. With her perfectly coiffed silver hair and a wardrobe that seemed to come straight out of a fashion magazine, she was the epitome of grace. Her culinary skills were the stuff of legend within the family. Stories of her soufflés that never fell and her turkeys that were always perfectly roasted had become lore. Sarah felt both admiration and a twinge of anxiety whenever she thought about impressing Margaret.

The day before Thanksgiving, Sarah’s home was a flurry of activity. She had taken the day off work to finalize preparations. The dining table was adorned with a crisp, white linen tablecloth, ironed to perfection, and set with the fine china they had received as a wedding gift but never used. She arranged a centerpiece of autumnal flowers—sunflowers, chrysanthemums, and sprigs of eucalyptus—that she had painstakingly selected from the florist. Tiny decorative gourds and candles completed the tableau, giving the room a warm, inviting glow.

In the kitchen, Sarah had laid out all the ingredients she would need. The star of the show was a magnificent 20-pound turkey, which she had named “Tom” in a fit of culinary affection—much to her husband’s amusement. She had brined Tom (the turkey, not her husband) overnight in a mixture of apple cider, brown sugar, and an array of aromatic herbs and spices. The recipe was from an obscure but highly recommended food blog called “The Gourmet Gobbler,” which promised a turkey so succulent it would bring tears to your eyes.

As evening fell, Sarah double-checked her extensive to-do list, which was as long as a CVS receipt and covered everything from basting schedules to bathroom cleanliness checks. Satisfied that she had thought of everything, she went to bed, visions of a flawless Thanksgiving dancing in her head.

Thanksgiving morning dawned crisp and clear, the kind of autumn day that poets write about. Sarah was up before the sun, her excitement outweighing her need for sleep. She donned her favorite apron—a kitschy number with “Kiss the Cook” emblazoned across it—and set to work. The turkey needed to go into the oven by 9 a.m. to be ready for the 3 p.m. dinner. She preheated the oven, carefully seasoning the turkey, and stuffed it with a fragrant mixture of onions, lemons, garlic, and fresh herbs.

As she heaved the hefty bird into the oven, she noticed the temperature knob felt a bit wobbly. “Hmm, I’ll have to get Tom to look at that later,” she mused, not realizing the foreshadowing significance of that thought. She set the oven to a gentle 325 degrees, as per the recipe, and set a timer to remind her to baste every hour.

With the turkey underway, Sarah turned her attention to the side dishes. She had an ambitious menu planned: creamy mashed potatoes, candied yams, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce made from scratch, cornbread stuffing, and her pièce de résistance—a pumpkin pie with a gingersnap crust.

As she began peeling potatoes, the doorbell rang. “Who could that be this early?” she wondered, glancing at the clock that read 8:30 a.m. Wiping her hands on her apron, she headed to the door.

Swinging it open, she was greeted by the sight of Uncle Bob, a broad grin stretching across his ruddy face. Dressed in a loud Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts—despite the November chill—he stood holding a six-pack of craft beer in one hand and a large cooler in the other.

“Happy Turkey Day!” he boomed.

“Uncle Bob! What a… surprise,” Sarah managed, masking her astonishment. “You’re here early.”

“Thought I’d come give you a hand. Can’t let you have all the fun,” he winked.

Uncle Bob was the family jokester, known for his terrible puns and his unique approach to “helping,” which often resulted in minor catastrophes. Sarah appreciated his intentions but was wary of the potential chaos.

“That’s very thoughtful of you,” she said diplomatically. “Why don’t you come in and make yourself comfortable?”

“Comfortable? Nonsense! Put me to work,” he insisted, stepping inside and setting the cooler down with a thud.

“Well, if you’re sure,” Sarah relented. “How about you start with the potatoes? They need to be peeled and chopped.”

“Potatoes? Easy peasy lemon squeezy,” he declared, rolling up his sleeves.

As Uncle Bob made his way to the kitchen, Sarah couldn’t shake a slight feeling of trepidation. But there was no time to dwell on that; she had a schedule to keep.

Returning to the kitchen, she found Uncle Bob attacking the pile of potatoes with gusto, peels flying in all directions. Max, ever the opportunist, was happily chasing the stray peels, skidding across the tile floor in delight.

“Careful, Uncle Bob,” Sarah cautioned. “We don’t want any accidents.”

“Don’t you worry about me,” he replied, narrowly missing his thumb as he chopped a particularly stubborn potato. “I’ve been peeling potatoes since before you were born!”

Sarah smiled weakly and decided it was best to focus on her tasks.

By 10 a.m., the kitchen was starting to buzz with activity—and not just from Sarah and Uncle Bob. The doorbell rang again, and this time it was Cousin Emily, the family’s free spirit. With her vibrant purple hair styled into a pixie cut and a nose ring that sparkled in the sunlight, she was impossible to miss.

“Aunt Sarah!” she exclaimed, enveloping her in a hug.

“Emily, so good to see you!” Sarah replied, genuinely happy to see her. “You’re early too!”

“Yeah, I thought I’d swing by and see if you needed any help. Also, I wanted to let you know I’m vegan now,” she said, her eyes wide with earnestness.

“Vegan? Since when?” Sarah asked, her mind racing through the menu to see what could accommodate this new development.

“Oh, it’s been a whole week! I watched this documentary, and it changed my life,” Emily said passionately.

“That’s… wonderful,” Sarah responded, trying to sound supportive. “Well, we have plenty of vegetables.”

“Great! I brought a quinoa and kale salad to share,” Emily announced, holding up a large Tupperware container.

“Perfect. Why don’t you put it in the fridge?” Sarah suggested, mentally adding ‘find vegan options’ to her ever-growing list.

As Emily bounced off to the kitchen, Sarah took a deep breath. This was fine. Everything was under control.

At 10:30 a.m., Grandpa Joe arrived. At 82 years old, he was still as feisty as ever, although his hearing wasn’t what it used to be. He shuffled in, leaning heavily on his cane, his thick glasses perched precariously on his nose.

“Where’s the football game?” he demanded loudly.

“Grandpa, the game doesn’t start until later this afternoon,” Sarah explained.

“What’s that? Afternoon? I already had breakfast!” he shouted back.

“Yes, Grandpa. Why don’t you have a seat in the living room? I’ll get you some coffee,” she offered.

“Don’t need coffee. Need the game,” he grumbled but made his way to the recliner in the living room.

Sarah sighed and went to fetch him a cup of tea instead, hoping it might soothe him.

By 11 a.m., the house was filling up faster than Sarah had anticipated. Aunt Linda breezed in next, her perfume preceding her arrival by several seconds. Dressed in a bright orange dress that matched the season, she carried several covered dishes precariously stacked in her arms.

“I brought my famous Jell-O salad and ambrosia!” she announced cheerfully.

“That’s… great, Aunt Linda,” Sarah said, trying to keep the apprehension out of her voice. Aunt Linda’s culinary creations were notorious in the family—not for their taste, but for their, shall we say, creativity. The Jell-O salad was a neon green concoction with mysterious floating objects, and the ambrosia was a marshmallow-laden dessert that glowed with an unnatural hue.

“Where should I put them?” Aunt Linda asked.

“How about on the sideboard in the dining room?” Sarah suggested, eager to keep them out of the main kitchen area.

As Aunt Linda headed to the dining room, Sarah heard a crash from the kitchen. Her heart leapt into her throat as she rushed to see what had happened.

In the kitchen, she found Uncle Bob standing amidst a sea of mashed potatoes. The pot had somehow tipped over, spilling the contents onto the floor.

“Oops!” he said sheepishly. “The pot slipped.”

Max was already investigating the mess, happily lapping up the starchy goodness.

“Uncle Bob!” Sarah exclaimed, trying to keep her frustration in check. “Are you okay?”

“Just fine. No harm done,” he assured her, although the evidence suggested otherwise.

“Let me help you clean up,” she said, grabbing some towels.

As they mopped up the mess, Sarah couldn’t help but notice the mashed potatoes were more akin to glue than the fluffy consistency she was aiming for.

“Did you add anything to the potatoes?” she asked cautiously.

“Just a bit of extra cream and a secret ingredient,” he winked.

“Secret ingredient?” Sarah echoed, dreading the answer.

“Mayonnaise! Gives it a nice tang,” he revealed proudly.

“Mayonnaise?” she repeated, her stomach turning slightly. “Well, that’s… innovative.”

“Trust me, everyone will love it,” he assured her.

Sarah forced a smile and decided that perhaps she should make a backup batch of mashed potatoes later if time allowed.

By noon, the kitchen was a whirlwind of activity. The timer reminded Sarah it was time to baste the turkey for the third time. She opened the oven and was greeted by an unexpected sight. The turkey’s skin was dark—very dark. In fact, it was nearly black.

“That can’t be right,” she muttered, poking at it with a baster. The skin crackled ominously.

“Something burning?” Uncle Bob called out, sniffing the air.

“I don’t think so,” Sarah replied, though uncertainty gnawed at her.

She closed the oven, attributing the darkness to the caramelization of the brine sugars. “It’ll be fine,” she told herself.

She moved on to the cranberry sauce, carefully simmering fresh cranberries with orange zest and cinnamon sticks. The scent was heavenly, and for a moment, she felt a wave of calm wash over her.

That tranquility was short-lived.

“Sarah, dear, the bathroom sink is leaking,” Aunt Linda called from down the hall.

“Leaking? Oh no,” Sarah groaned. “I’ll be right there.”

She hurried to the bathroom to find Aunt Linda standing ankle-deep in water. Apparently, the twins—Sarah and Tom’s three-year-old daughters, Lily and Rose—had decided it was the perfect time to test how many tissues could fit into the sink before turning on the faucet.

“Oh my goodness!” Sarah exclaimed. “I’m so sorry, Aunt Linda.”

“Kids will be kids,” Aunt Linda smiled, stepping carefully out of the water.

Sarah quickly turned off the faucet and began mopping up the mess. She made a mental note to find the twins and keep a closer eye on them.

As she cleaned, she heard a loud crash from the kitchen. Panic surged through her as she rushed back.

This time, it was Cousin Emily, who had dropped a glass bowl, sending shards skittering across the floor.

“I’m so sorry!” Emily apologized, her face flushed with embarrassment. “It just slipped.”

“It’s okay,” Sarah assured her, grabbing the broom and dustpan. “Accidents happen.”

As she swept up the glass, she couldn’t help but feel the weight of the day pressing down on her.

By 1 p.m., the rest of the family had arrived. The noise level in the house had risen significantly. The twins were running around playing tag with Max, who was enthusiastically joining in. Grandpa Joe had found the remote and was flipping through channels at a volume that could be heard from space. Aunt Linda was regaling everyone with tales of her recent cruise, complete with an excessive number of selfies being passed around.

Amidst the chaos, Sarah realized she hadn’t seen Tom in a while.

“Where’s your father?” she asked the twins as they zoomed past.

“Daddy’s in the garage!” Lily shouted over her shoulder.

“The garage?” Sarah muttered, making her way there.

She found Tom tinkering with a broken lawn mower, grease smudged on his face.

“Tom! What are you doing?” she asked, exasperated.

“Hey, honey. Uncle Steve mentioned the mower was making a weird noise, so I thought I’d take a look,” he explained.

“Now? In the middle of Thanksgiving?” she pressed.

“Well, he seemed concerned, and I thought it’d be quick,” he said sheepishly.

“Tom, I need your help inside. The kids are wreaking havoc, the sink overflowed, and the turkey might be burning,” she rattled off.

“Burning? That’s not good,” he said, wiping his hands on a rag. “Okay, I’m coming.”

They headed back inside, and Tom went to corral the twins while Sarah checked on the turkey again.

This time, when she opened the oven, smoke billowed out, triggering the smoke alarm.

The piercing beep of the alarm sent everyone into a frenzy.

“Fire!” Grandpa Joe shouted, jumping up from his chair.

“No, no, it’s just smoke!” Sarah tried to reassure everyone, coughing as she waved a towel at the alarm.

Uncle Bob grabbed a chair and attempted to disable the alarm, but in his haste, he knocked it off the ceiling, causing it to hang by its wires, still blaring incessantly.

Max, startled by the noise, began barking and running in circles, which excited the twins even more.

In the midst of the chaos, Sarah looked at the turkey. The skin was charred beyond recognition, resembling a lump of coal. She poked it with a meat thermometer, hoping for some sign of salvation. The temperature read 120 degrees—far below the safe threshold.

“How can it be burnt on the outside and raw on the inside?” she exclaimed in frustration.

Margaret chose that moment to arrive, stepping into the house with impeccable timing.

“Hello, everyone,” she announced, taking in the scene with a raised eyebrow.

“Mother! You’re here,” Tom said, hurrying over to greet her.

“Indeed. It seems I’ve arrived at an… eventful moment,” she observed.

Sarah felt her cheeks flush. This was not how she wanted Margaret to see her first Thanksgiving as hostess.

“I’m so sorry about the chaos,” Sarah began, trying to regain composure. “The turkey seems to be… uncooperative.”

Margaret gave her a sympathetic smile. “May I take a look?”

“Please,” Sarah gestured toward the kitchen.

They moved to the oven, and Margaret inspected the turkey with a practiced eye.

“Ah, I see the problem,” she said, adjusting her glasses. “The oven is set to ‘Broil’ instead of ‘Bake.’ That’s why the top is burnt while the inside is undercooked.”

Sarah’s heart sank. “Oh no. The temperature knob was loose earlier. I must have accidentally set it to the wrong setting.”

“Easy mistake to make,” Margaret reassured her. “Let’s see what we can salvage.”

She expertly adjusted the oven settings and suggested tenting the turkey with foil to prevent further browning while the inside cooked.

“Thank you,” Sarah said, her voice tinged with both relief and embarrassment.

“Think nothing of it. Turkeys can be tricky creatures,” Margaret smiled.

With the turkey crisis momentarily at bay, Sarah turned her attention to the side dishes. She sampled the mashed potatoes and nearly gagged. Uncle Bob’s “secret ingredient” had turned them into a tangy, gluey paste. The green bean casserole was burnt around the edges, the result of being left in the oven too long while she dealt with other disasters. The cranberry sauce was still simmering but had reduced to a sticky, jam-like substance. And she had completely forgotten to take the pumpkin pie out of the freezer.

“Is everything okay?” Tom asked, sensing her distress.

“No,” Sarah said flatly. “I’ve ruined Thanksgiving.”

“Come on, it can’t be that bad,” he tried to console her.

“Look at this!” she gestured wildly at the array of culinary catastrophes. “The turkey is a mess, the sides are inedible, and we have no dessert!”

“Well, we have Aunt Linda’s Jell-O salad,” he offered.

Sarah shot him a look that could wither flowers.

“Okay, not helping,” he admitted.

“Maybe we can order takeout?” Emily suggested, having overheard the conversation.

“On Thanksgiving?” Margaret interjected, clearly appalled at the notion.

“Actually, that might be our only option,” Sarah conceded, feeling defeated.

Uncle Bob chimed in, “Hey, there’s that new pizza place that delivers. They have a Thanksgiving special with turkey toppings!”

“Pizza? On Thanksgiving?” Margaret repeated, her tone suggesting the idea was blasphemous.

“Why not? It’s a new tradition!” Emily enthused. “Plus, they have vegan options.”

Sarah sighed. “At this point, I’m open to anything.”

Just then, the lights flickered and went out, plunging the house into an eerie semi-darkness. The hum of the appliances ceased, and the house fell silent except for the collective groans of the family.

“Power outage,” Grandpa Joe declared, as if announcing an apocalypse.

“You’re kidding me,” Sarah muttered. She checked her phone—no signal.

“Must be the storm,” Tom said, peering out the window at the gathering clouds. “I didn’t even notice it was getting so dark.”

“Well, this is just perfect,” Sarah said, throwing her hands up.

“Maybe it’s a sign,” Uncle Bob mused.

“A sign of what?” Margaret asked.

“That we should go back to basics. You know, like the Pilgrims did,” he suggested.

“Pretty sure the Pilgrims didn’t have to deal with burnt turkeys and vegan cousins,” Sarah quipped, a hint of hysteria in her voice.

“Hey!” Emily protested, but smiled nonetheless.

“Alright, everyone,” Margaret said, taking charge. “Let’s all gather in the living room. We’ll make the best of this.”

Candles were lit, casting a warm glow around the room. The family settled in, sitting on couches and floor cushions. The atmosphere, though initially tense, began to soften.

“Since we can’t proceed with dinner just yet, perhaps we can share what we’re thankful for,” Margaret suggested.

“Good idea,” Tom agreed.

“I’ll start,” Uncle Bob volunteered. “I’m thankful for family and for gluey mashed potatoes—they keep my insides warm and my teeth stuck together!”

Laughter rippled through the room, easing the lingering tension.

“I’m thankful for new beginnings,” Emily said. “And for families that accept sudden lifestyle changes without too much judgment.”

“Here, here,” Aunt Linda cheered, raising an imaginary glass.

Grandpa Joe leaned forward. “I’m thankful for good company and that I can still taste food, even if I can’t hear half of what’s being said!”

More laughter ensued.

When it was Margaret’s turn, she looked directly at Sarah. “I’m thankful for my wonderful daughter-in-law, who has shown grace under pressure and reminds us that the true meaning of Thanksgiving isn’t about a perfect meal but about coming together as a family.”

Sarah felt a lump in her throat. “Thank you,” she whispered.

“I’m thankful for all of you,” she continued, her voice wavering slightly. “Even when things go awry, you all make it memorable.”

“Group hug!” Uncle Bob declared, opening his arms wide.

“Please, no,” Grandpa Joe protested, but was promptly pulled into a hug anyway.

Just then, the lights flickered back on. A collective cheer went up.

“Looks like the power’s back!” Tom announced.

“Maybe we can salvage dinner after all,” Sarah said, hope rekindling.

“Let’s do this,” Margaret said, standing up. “Everyone, to the kitchen!”

With renewed energy, the family sprang into action. Under Margaret’s guidance, they devised a plan to rescue the meal.

“First, the turkey,” she said. “Tom, help me move it to the carving board.”

They carefully lifted the turkey, and Margaret began expertly carving away the burnt skin, revealing moist, perfectly cooked meat beneath.

“See? Not all is lost,” she smiled.

Sarah felt a surge of relief.

“Emily, could you prepare that quinoa and kale salad you brought?” Margaret asked.

“Absolutely!” Emily replied, heading to the kitchen.

“Aunt Linda, your ambrosia would make a lovely dessert,” Sarah suggested, genuinely appreciative for the first time.

“Oh, wonderful! I knew it would come in handy,” Aunt Linda beamed.

“Uncle Bob,” Margaret began, pausing to consider his assignment carefully. “Why don’t you open the wine?”

“Now that’s a job I can handle!” he laughed.

“Grandpa Joe, would you like to say grace when we sit down?” Sarah asked.

“Be my honor,” he nodded.

Tom set about reheating the side dishes that could be salvaged, and Sarah whipped up a quick batch of mashed potatoes from instant mix she found in the pantry—thankful for her tendency to overstock non-perishables.

Within an hour, the table was set, and the food was arranged in a delightful spread. It wasn’t the gourmet feast Sarah had envisioned, but it was warm, plentiful, and made with collective effort.

As they gathered around the table, Grandpa Joe stood at the head.

“Let us bow our heads,” he began. “Dear Lord, we thank you for this food, for family, and for the blessings we often take for granted. May we always remember that it’s not the perfection of the meal that matters, but the love with which it is prepared and shared. Amen.”

“Amen,” the family echoed.

They took their seats, and for a moment, there was a peaceful silence as everyone took in the scene.

“Well, dig in!” Uncle Bob broke the silence, reaching for the turkey.

Conversation flowed easily as they ate. The turkey was surprisingly delicious, the quinoa salad was a hit even among the meat-eaters, and Aunt Linda’s ambrosia was met with genuine appreciation.

“These mashed potatoes are great,” Uncle Bob said, oblivious to the fact that they weren’t his.

“Glad you like them,” Sarah smiled.

“See, everything turned out fine,” Tom whispered to her, squeezing her hand under the table.

“Better than fine,” she agreed.

Max sat patiently by the table, his tail wagging hopefully. The twins, seated on either side of Sarah, were miraculously behaving, perhaps sensing the importance of the moment.

As the meal wound down, the family lingered at the table, reluctant to let the evening end.

“I think this calls for a toast,” Margaret said, raising her glass. “To Sarah, for hosting a memorable Thanksgiving, and to family—may we always find joy in each other’s company, no matter the circumstances.”

“To family!” everyone echoed, clinking glasses.

Uncle Bob stood up. “And to new traditions! Like Thanksgiving pizza and mashed potatoes with secret ingredients!”

Laughter filled the room.

“Please, no pizza next year,” Margaret said, though her eyes twinkled with amusement.

“Agreed,” Sarah laughed. “But maybe we’ll keep the secret ingredient.”

“That’s the spirit!” Uncle Bob cheered.

Later that evening, as the guests began to depart, Sarah and Tom stood at the door, bidding them farewell.

“Thank you so much for coming,” Sarah told each of them sincerely.

“Best Thanksgiving ever!” Emily declared, hugging her tightly.

“You did a wonderful job, dear,” Aunt Linda added. “Can’t wait for next year!”

“Next year, deep-fried turkey!” Uncle Bob suggested with a mischievous grin.

“We’ll see about that,” Sarah chuckled.

“Goodnight, my dear,” Margaret said, hugging Sarah warmly. “I’m proud of you.”

“Thank you, Margaret,” Sarah replied, her heart full.

As the last car pulled away, Sarah closed the door and leaned against it, letting out a contented sigh.

“We did it,” she said to Tom.

“You did it,” he corrected. “I mostly just caused trouble.”

“Well, you can make it up to me by helping with the dishes,” she teased.

“Deal,” he agreed.

They headed to the kitchen, which was, unsurprisingly, a disaster zone. Pots and pans were piled high, and remnants of food clung to every surface.

“Maybe we should just burn the house down and start over,” Tom joked.

“Tempting,” Sarah laughed. “But let’s save arson as a last resort.”

They set to work, and with both of them pitching in, the kitchen was soon restored to order.

Exhausted, they collapsed onto the couch. Max jumped up to join them, settling his head on Sarah’s lap.

“Hey, buddy,” she said, scratching behind his ears. “Did you enjoy your Thanksgiving?”

Max thumped his tail in response.

“Looks like he did,” Tom observed. “I saw him sneak a few bites from Uncle Bob.”

“Traitor,” Sarah said, but smiled nonetheless.

The twins had already been put to bed, worn out from the day’s excitement. The house was finally quiet.

“You know,” Sarah began, “I was so focused on making everything perfect that I forgot what Thanksgiving is really about.”

“Burnt turkeys and power outages?” Tom teased.

She elbowed him gently. “No, smarty pants. Family. Coming together, imperfections and all.”

“Well, in that case, I’d say it was a perfect Thanksgiving,” he said.

She leaned her head on his shoulder. “You might be right.”

They sat in comfortable silence, the only sound the soft ticking of the clock and Max’s contented sighs.

“Next year,” Sarah mused, “maybe we’ll keep it simpler. Less pressure, more enjoyment.”

“I like the sound of that,” Tom agreed. “But no matter what happens, we’ll handle it together.”

“Deal,” she said, lifting her head to kiss his cheek.

As they made their way upstairs, Sarah took one last look at the dining room. The table was cleared, but the memories of the laughter and togetherness lingered.

She realized that despite the mishaps—or perhaps because of them—this Thanksgiving had brought the family closer. The imperfections had made it authentic, and the shared efforts had strengthened their bonds.

Climbing into bed, she felt a profound sense of gratitude. Not just for the family she had married into, but for the lessons learned.

“Goodnight,” Tom whispered, switching off the lamp.

“Goodnight,” she replied, snuggling into the warmth of the covers.

As she drifted off to sleep, Sarah couldn’t help but smile, already looking forward to the next Thanksgiving—whatever it might bring.
